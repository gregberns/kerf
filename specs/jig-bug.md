# Bug Jig

> Built-in jig for investigating defects and specifying fixes.

Something is broken. This jig guides an agent through a structured investigation: capture the report, research the codebase, reproduce the problem, identify the root cause, and specify the fix — before any code is written. See [jig-system.md](jig-system.md) for file format, resolution, and versioning. See [jig-plan.md](jig-plan.md) and [jig-spec.md](jig-spec.md) for the other built-in jigs.

## When to Use

Use the `bug` jig when the work involves a defect in existing behavior. The reported behavior does not match the expected behavior, and the goal is to investigate, locate, and specify a fix. If the work involves designing something new or substantially changing existing behavior, use the [`plan`](jig-plan.md) jig instead. If the work involves updating a living system specification, use the [`spec`](jig-spec.md) jig.

## Status Progression

```
reported -> research -> reproducing -> root-cause -> fix-spec -> ready
```

## Frontmatter

The `bug` jig file contains this YAML frontmatter:

## Passes

### Pass 1: Report (reported)

**Output:** `01-report.md`

Capture a clear, precise bug report that establishes the facts before any investigation begins.

#### Agent Instructions

**What to do:**

1. Read the bug report or user description carefully. Identify what behavior was observed and what behavior was expected.
2. Capture the reported behavior and expected behavior as precise, observable statements. "The CLI returns exit code 0 when validation fails" not "it doesn't work right."
3. Identify the affected area — the command, endpoint, module, or subsystem where the bug manifests.
4. Record environment details if known: OS, versions, configuration, dependencies.
5. Collect any existing evidence: error messages, log output, stack traces, screenshots, or links to related issues.
6. Record steps to reproduce if the reporter provided them. If not, note that reproduction steps are unknown — Research and Reproduce passes will establish them.
7. Assess severity and impact:
   - **Critical** — data loss, security vulnerability, or complete feature unavailability
   - **High** — major functionality broken, no workaround
   - **Medium** — functionality impaired, workaround exists
   - **Low** — cosmetic, minor inconvenience, or edge case
8. Determine whether this is actually a bug, a feature gap, or a misunderstanding. If it is not a bug, document that conclusion and stop.
9. Save to `01-report.md`.

**What "done" looks like:**

- `01-report.md` contains: reported behavior, expected behavior, affected area, environment (if known), evidence collected, steps to reproduce (if known), severity with justification, and assessment (confirmed bug / feature gap / needs investigation).
- The report is precise enough that another agent reading it could begin investigating without asking clarifying questions.

### Pass 2: Research (research)

**Output:** `02-research.md`

Investigate the codebase to understand the problem area before attempting reproduction. Structure the investigation around explicit questions.

#### Agent Instructions

**What to do:**

1. Based on the bug report, formulate 3-5 specific investigation questions. These should guide the research and produce concrete answers. Examples:
   - "What code handles this endpoint/command/path?"
   - "How is this input validated and processed?"
   - "When was this code last modified, and what changed?"
   - "Are there existing tests covering this behavior?"
   - "Are there related bug reports or known issues?"
2. For each question, investigate systematically:
   - Read the relevant source code. Trace the execution path from the entry point through the affected area.
   - Check git history for recent changes to the affected code — `git log` and `git blame` on the relevant files.
   - Search for related issues, error patterns, or similar bugs elsewhere in the codebase.
   - Review existing tests to understand what is and is not covered.
3. Document each question and its findings. Be specific — name files, functions, line ranges, commit hashes.
4. Identify any surprising discoveries or additional questions that emerged during research.
5. Save to `02-research.md`.

**What "done" looks like:**

- `02-research.md` contains: each investigation question with its findings, relevant code paths identified, recent changes noted, test coverage assessment, and any additional questions or surprises discovered.
- The research provides enough understanding of the problem area to inform reproduction and root cause analysis.

### Pass 3: Reproduce (reproducing)

**Output:** `03-reproduction.md`

Build a minimal reproduction case that proves the bug exists and isolates the triggering conditions.

#### Agent Instructions

**What to do:**

1. Using the bug report and research findings, define exact steps to reproduce the bug. Number each step. Include specific inputs, commands, or actions.
2. Execute the steps and confirm the bug occurs. Record the actual output.
3. Narrow to the minimal reproduction — the smallest set of steps, inputs, and configuration that triggers the bug. Remove anything unnecessary.
4. Document environment requirements: OS, versions, configuration, dependencies, or state that must be present for the bug to manifest.
5. If the bug cannot be reproduced:
   - Document every approach attempted and why each failed.
   - Note whether the bug is intermittent, environment-specific, or dependent on state that is difficult to recreate.
   - Escalate to the user with a clear summary of what was tried. Do not proceed to Pass 4 without either a reproduction or an explicit decision from the user to continue.
6. Save to `03-reproduction.md`.

**What "done" looks like:**

- `03-reproduction.md` contains: numbered steps to reproduce, minimal reproduction case, environment requirements, observed output, and reproduction status (reliably reproduced / intermittent / not reproduced).
- Another agent or developer can follow the steps and observe the same bug.

### Pass 4: Root Cause (root-cause)

**Output:** `04-root-cause.md`

Based on research and reproduction, identify why the bug exists — not just where the code fails, but the underlying defect.

#### Agent Instructions

**What to do:**

1. Trace the reproduction steps through the code path identified during Research. Follow execution from the entry point to the failure.
2. Identify the specific defect: what the code does wrong and why. Explain the logical error, incorrect assumption, missing check, race condition, or other flaw.
3. Determine when the bug was introduced, if possible. Check git history for the commit that introduced or exposed the defect.
4. Assess the blast radius — what other code paths, features, or behaviors depend on or are affected by the broken code. Cross-reference with Research findings on related patterns.
5. Summarize the root cause in one sentence that another developer would understand without reading the full analysis.
6. Save to `04-root-cause.md`.

**What "done" looks like:**

- `04-root-cause.md` contains: one-sentence root cause summary, detailed explanation of the defect, execution trace from entry to failure (with file/function references), when introduced (if determinable), and blast radius assessment.
- The root cause explains *why* the bug exists, not just *where* the code fails.

#### Review Criteria

After completing this pass, spawn a review sub-agent (see [jig-system.md](jig-system.md) §Review Pattern for the sub-agent delegation protocol) with:
- `04-root-cause.md`
- `02-research.md` (for cross-reference)
- `03-reproduction.md` (to verify the trace matches the reproduction)

The reviewer checks:
- The root cause explains *why*, not just *where* — there is a logical explanation, not just a line number
- The execution trace is consistent with the reproduction steps
- The blast radius assessment is complete — no obvious affected areas are missed
- Research findings are incorporated, not contradicted
- The one-sentence summary accurately captures the defect

Up to 3 review rounds. After that, present artifacts and any remaining findings to the user for approval.

### Pass 5: Fix Spec (fix-spec)

**Output:** `05-fix-spec.md`

Specify the fix so that an implementing agent knows exactly what to change, without writing implementation code.

#### Agent Instructions

**What to do:**

1. Propose the fix approach. Describe the change at the level of logic and structure — what condition to add, what function to modify, what data flow to correct. Do not write implementation code.
2. If there are multiple viable approaches, list them with tradeoffs and recommend one.
3. Identify risks or side effects of the fix. Will it change any public API? Affect performance? Alter behavior in cases that currently work correctly?
4. If this is a spec-first project: identify what spec changes are needed to reflect the correct behavior.
5. Define acceptance criteria — concrete, testable conditions that confirm the fix works:
   - The original reproduction case passes after the fix.
   - Boundary conditions around the fix are covered.
   - Related patterns identified in Root Cause are addressed or explicitly scoped out.
6. Define tests to add or modify:
   - Tests that verify the fix resolves the bug.
   - Regression tests that prevent recurrence.
   - Tests for blast radius areas, if applicable.
7. Estimate scope: which files change, approximate number of changes, and complexity (trivial / straightforward / involved).
8. Save to `05-fix-spec.md`.

**What "done" looks like:**

- `05-fix-spec.md` contains: proposed fix approach, alternatives considered (if any), risks and side effects, spec changes needed (if spec-first), acceptance criteria, tests to add/modify, and scope estimate.
- An implementing agent can read this file and know exactly what to change and how to verify the fix.

#### Review Criteria

After completing this pass, spawn a review sub-agent with:
- `05-fix-spec.md`
- `04-root-cause.md` (to verify the fix addresses the root cause)
- `01-report.md` (to verify acceptance criteria cover the reported behavior)

The reviewer checks:
- The fix addresses the root cause, not just the symptom
- Acceptance criteria are concrete and testable — no vague "works correctly" statements
- Risks and side effects are realistic, not hand-waved
- Scope estimate is plausible given the root cause and proposed approach
- If spec-first: spec changes are identified and consistent with the fix

Up to 3 review rounds. After that, present artifacts and any remaining findings to the user for approval.

### Pass 6: Ready (ready)

**Output:** none

Run `kerf square <codename>` to verify all expected artifacts exist. The bug investigation is complete and the fix spec is ready for implementation. kerf's job ends here — implementation and verification use whatever tooling the team prefers.

#### Agent Instructions

**What to do:**
1. Run `kerf square <codename>` to verify all expected artifacts exist.
2. If square fails, return to the appropriate pass to produce the missing artifacts.
3. Once square passes, the bug investigation is complete.

**What done looks like:**
- `kerf square` reports SQUARE
- All 5 artifact files exist and are populated
- The fix spec is specific enough for an implementer to act on without additional context

## Finalization

When the work reaches `ready` status and `kerf square` passes, the work is eligible for [finalization](finalization.md). `kerf finalize <codename>` packages the investigation and fix spec for implementation handoff.

## File Structure

A work governed by the `bug` jig contains the following files:

```
{codename}/
  spec.yaml
  SESSION.md
  01-report.md
  02-research.md
  03-reproduction.md
  04-root-cause.md
  05-fix-spec.md
```

`spec.yaml` and `SESSION.md` are defined in [works.md](works.md) and [sessions.md](sessions.md) respectively. All other files are pass outputs defined by this jig.
